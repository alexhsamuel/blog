<ul>
  <li>stat arb = statistical arbitrage = making money by predicting which prices are slightly likely (far from certain!) to go up or down, and taking a number of positions that are fairly likely to go up in aggregate even if some are up and some are down</li>
  <li>quant = quantitative = run by mathematical or statistical models, as opposed to “discretionary” which is run by human judgement</li>
  <li>automated = computers do the trading, not people</li>
  <li>trading team = front office team = a group that is directly responsible for some capital and makes investment decisions, as opposed to “mid office” and “back office” which are concerned with trading operations and accounting, or firm-wide technology teams which serve a number of trading groups as clients</li>
  <li>hedge fund = alternative investment manager = company that invests capital on behalf of clients; can invest in nearly anything; supposed to make money in any market conditions (thus “hedge”… hedged against market downturns)</li>
  <li>prop trading = proprietary trading = a company investing its own capital</li>
  <li>family office = prop fund of a single wealthy individual</li>
  <li>HFT = high frequency trading = companies that make money by doing millions of little trades but holding positions for very short periods of time (Flash Boys)</li>
  <li>buy side = businesses that invest capital</li>
  <li>sell side = businesses that service the buy side, mainly banks</li>
  <li>bank (in our context) = big integrated financial firm
    <ul>
      <li>investment banking = advising corporate clients on raising money and capital structure</li>
      <li>capital markets = trading and other services to clients such as hedge funds</li>
      <li>commercial banking = something to do with lending money to companies and managing trade (?)</li>
      <li>consumer banking = savings/checking accounts, ATMs, credit cards, investment accounts, mortgages, student loans, …</li>
      <li>others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="job-functions">Job functions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>quant = quantitative researcher = builds mathematical models of asset prices and other things</li>
  <li>dev = developer = engineer = technologist = writes software and designs computer systems</li>
  <li>quant/dev = quantitative developer = dev who works on more mathematical software as opposed to infrastructure and systems engineering</li>
  <li>trader = makes trades and/or monitors automated trading</li>
  <li>analyst = analyzes and understands some facet of financial markets; might do some quant work</li>
  <li>data scientist = term from outside finance for someone who analyzes data, possibly builds models from data; kind of like quant</li>
  <li>data engineer = dev who specializes in systems for processing data</li>
  <li>devops = in charge for maintaining and monitoring software systems</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="asset-classes">Asset classes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>equities = stocks</li>
  <li>futures = simple derivatives used mainly to trade things that are hard to trade directly
    <ul>
      <li>energy (oil, natural gas, electricity)</li>
      <li>metals (gold, silver, copper)</li>
      <li>agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soy, cattle, pork bellies, OJ, coffee)</li>
      <li>lots of others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>FX = foreign exchange = currencies = foreign currencies like GBP, EUR, JPY</li>
  <li>vol = volatility = derivatives linked to how much prices bounce around rather than whether they go up or down, mainly options</li>
  <li>FI = fixed income = instruments that (are supposed to) pay fixed cash flows
    <ul>
      <li>corporate bonds</li>
      <li>sovereign bonds (i.e. issued by national governments)</li>
      <li>derivatives linked to interest rates</li>
      <li>lots of others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="firms">Firms</h4>

<ul>
  <li>fintech: companies selling financial products or services
    <ul>
      <li>consumer fintech: Betterment, Oscar</li>
      <li>institutional fintech: sell to other finance companies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>hedge funds
    <ul>
      <li>big: Two Sigma, D.E. Shaw, Citadel, Millenium, WorldQuant, Renaissance Technology</li>
      <li>small (there are thousands)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HFT: Hudson River Trading, Jump Trading, Virtu, Tower Research, Knight Capital</li>
  <li>banks
    <ul>

      <li>big foreign banks: UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, HSBC, BNP, SocGen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there is overlap: for instance Citadel, Two Sigma, and Millennium all
do HFT as well, and banks may do HFT and other prop trading (but less so since
2008).</p>
