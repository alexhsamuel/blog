This is a brain dump of hedge fund terminology.

- stat arb = statistical arbitrage = making money by predicting which prices are slightly likely (far from certain!) to go up or down, and taking a number of positions that are fairly likely to go up in aggregate even if some are up and some are down
- quant = quantitative = run by mathematical or statistical models, as opposed to “discretionary” which is run by human judgement
- automated = computers do the trading, not people
- trading team = front office team = a group that is directly responsible for some capital and makes investment decisions, as opposed to “mid office” and “back office” which are concerned with trading operations and accounting, or firm-wide technology teams which serve a number of trading groups as clients
- hedge fund = alternative investment manager = company that invests capital on behalf of clients; can invest in nearly anything; supposed to make money in any market conditions (thus “hedge”… hedged against market downturns)
- prop trading = proprietary trading = a company investing its own capital
- family office = prop fund of a single wealthy individual
- HFT = high frequency trading = companies that make money by doing millions of little trades but holding positions for very short periods of time (Flash Boys)
- buy side = businesses that invest capital
- sell side = businesses that service the buy side, mainly banks
- bank (in our context) = big integrated financial firm
  - investment banking = advising corporate clients on raising money and capital structure
  - capital markets = trading and other services to clients such as hedge funds
  - commercial banking = something to do with lending money to companies and managing trade (?)
  - consumer banking = savings/checking accounts, ATMs, credit cards, investment accounts, mortgages, student loans, ...
  - others


### Job functions

- quant = quantitative researcher = builds mathematical models of asset prices and other things
- dev = developer = engineer = technologist = writes software and designs computer systems
- quant/dev = quantitative developer = dev who works on more mathematical software as opposed to infrastructure and systems engineering
- trader = makes trades and/or monitors automated trading
- analyst = analyzes and understands some facet of financial markets; might do some quant work
- data scientist = term from outside finance for someone who analyzes data, possibly builds models from data; kind of like quant
- data engineer = dev who specializes in systems for processing data
- devops = in charge for maintaining and monitoring software systems


### Asset classes

- equities = stocks
- futures = simple derivatives used mainly to trade things that are hard to trade directly
  - energy (oil, natural gas, electricity)
  - metals (gold, silver, copper)
  - agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soy, cattle, pork bellies, OJ, coffee)
  - lots of others
- FX = foreign exchange = currencies = foreign currencies like GBP, EUR, JPY
- vol = volatility = derivatives linked to how much prices bounce around rather than whether they go up or down, mainly options
- FI = fixed income = instruments that (are supposed to) pay fixed cash flows
  - corporate bonds
  - sovereign bonds (i.e. issued by national governments)
  - derivatives linked to interest rates
  - lots of others


#### Firms

- fintech: companies selling financial products or services
  - consumer fintech: Betterment, Oscar
  - institutional fintech: sell to other finance companies
- hedge funds
  - big: Two Sigma, D.E. Shaw, Citadel, Millenium, WorldQuant, Renaissance Technology
  - small (there are thousands)
- HFT: Hudson River Trading, Jump Trading, Virtu, Tower Research, Knight Capital
- banks
  - big five (US): Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Citi, BofA/Merrill Lynch
  - big foreign banks: UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, HSBC, BNP, SocGen

Note that there is overlap: for instance Citadel, Two Sigma, and Millennium all
do HFT as well, and banks may do HFT and other prop trading (but less so since
2008).
