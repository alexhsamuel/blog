        <title>hedge fund glossary</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;hedge-fund-glossary&quot;&gt;Hedge fund glossary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;stat arb = statistical arbitrage = making money by predicting which prices are slightly likely (far from certain!) to go up or down, and taking a number of positions that are fairly likely to go up in aggregate even if some are up and some are down&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quant = quantitative = run by mathematical or statistical models, as opposed to “discretionary” which is run by human judgement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;automated = computers do the trading, not people&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trading team = front office team = a group that is directly responsible for some capital and makes investment decisions, as opposed to “mid office” and “back office” which are concerned with trading operations and accounting, or firm-wide technology teams which serve a number of trading groups as clients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hedge fund = alternative investment manager = company that invests capital on behalf of clients; can invest in nearly anything; supposed to make money in any market conditions (thus “hedge”… hedged against market downturns)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;prop trading = proprietary trading = a company investing its own capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;family office = prop fund of a single wealthy individual&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HFT = high frequency trading = companies that make money by doing millions of little trades but holding positions for very short periods of time (Flash Boys)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;buy side = businesses that invest capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sell side = businesses that service the buy side, mainly banks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bank (in our context) = big integrated financial firm
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;investment banking = advising corporate clients on raising money and capital structure&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;capital markets = trading and other services to clients such as hedge funds&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;commercial banking = something to do with lending money to companies and managing trade (?)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;consumer banking = savings/checking accounts, ATMs, credit cards, investment accounts, mortgages, student loans, …&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;others&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;job-functions&quot;&gt;Job functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quant = quantitative researcher = builds mathematical models of asset prices and other things&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dev = developer = engineer = technologist = writes software and designs computer systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quant/dev = quantitative developer = dev who works on more mathematical software as opposed to infrastructure and systems engineering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;trader = makes trades and/or monitors automated trading&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;analyst = analyzes and understands some facet of financial markets; might do some quant work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data scientist = term from outside finance for someone who analyzes data, possibly builds models from data; kind of like quant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;data engineer = dev who specializes in systems for processing data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;devops = in charge for maintaining and monitoring software systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asset-classes&quot;&gt;Asset classes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;equities = stocks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;futures = simple derivatives used mainly to trade things that are hard to trade directly
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;energy (oil, natural gas, electricity)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;metals (gold, silver, copper)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;agricultural commodities (corn, wheat, soy, cattle, pork bellies, OJ, coffee)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lots of others&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FX = foreign exchange = currencies = foreign currencies like GBP, EUR, JPY&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vol = volatility = derivatives linked to how much prices bounce around rather than whether they go up or down, mainly options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FI = fixed income = instruments that (are supposed to) pay fixed cash flows
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;corporate bonds&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;sovereign bonds (i.e. issued by national governments)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;derivatives linked to interest rates&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;lots of others&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;firms&quot;&gt;Firms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fintech: companies selling financial products or services
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;consumer fintech: Betterment, Oscar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;institutional fintech: sell to other finance companies&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hedge funds
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;big: Two Sigma, D.E. Shaw, Citadel, Millenium, WorldQuant, Renaissance Technology&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;small (there are thousands)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HFT: Hudson River Trading, Jump Trading, Virtu, Tower Research, Knight Capital&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;banks
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;big five (US): Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Citi, BofA/Merrill Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;big foreign banks: UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, HSBC, BNP, SocGen&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that there is overlap: for instance Citadel, Two Sigma, and Millennium all
do HFT as well, and banks may do HFT and other prop trading (but less so since
2008).&lt;/p&gt;
